# GPUFORT

This project develops a source to source translation tool that is able to convert:

1. Fortran+OpenACC and CUDA Fortran -> Fortran + OpenMP 4.5+
2. Fortran+OpenACC and CUDA Fortran -> Fortran + [GCC/AOMP OpenACC/MP runtime calls] + HIP C++

The result of the first translation process, can be compiled
with AOMP, which has a Fortran frontend.
The result of the second translation process can be compiled
with hipfort or a combination of hipcc and gfortran.
Note that a OpenACC runtime is only necessary for translating
OpenACC code.

An overview of the different translation paths that we work on is shown below:

**NOTE:** GPUFORT is a research project. We made it publicly available because 
we believe that it might be helpful for some.
We want to stress that the code translation and code generation outputs produced
by GPUFORT will in most cases require manual reviewing and fixing.

## Installation and usage

Please take a look at the (slightly outdated) [user guide](https://rocmsoftwareplatform.github.io/gpufort/).

### Quick start for generating and compiling HIP code form Fortran

Before you can run HIP code generated by GPUFORT, you need to 
build the GPUFORT static libraries and/or 
offloading runtime for AMD and/or NVIDIA devices.
Assuming HIPFORT is installed, you can compile them via:

```bash
HIP_PLATFORM=amd FC=hipfc make clean_all all # use HIP_PLATFORM=nvidia for NVIDIA devices

# or without hipfc:

FC="gfortran" HIPFORT_INC="/home/wrf/Builds/hipfort/install/include/hipfort/amdgcn" HIP_PLATFORM="amd" make clean_all all
```

After compiling successfully, take a look at the 
CUDA Fortran and OpenACC examples in the `examples/` subdirectory,
which all come with a Makefile for generating code and building
the examples.

## Implementation details

[This presentation](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/gpufort/blob/main/gpufort_slides.pdf)
gives an overview of GPUFORT's building blocks.

## Limitations

* GPUFORT is not a compiler (yet)

GPUFORT is not intended to be a compiler.
It's main purpose is to be a translator that allows
an experienced user to fix and tune the outcomes
of the translation process. 
However, we believe GPUFORT can develop into an 
early-outlining compiler if enough effort 
is put into the project.
Given that all code and especially the grammar is
written in python3, GPUFORT can be developed at a quick 
pace.

* GPUFORT assumes syntactically and functionally correct input

GPUFORT does only perform a small number of syntax checks as we assume
that developers apply GPUFORT to code that can be run correctly on CUDA devices.
(We plan to add the option to prescribe a user-specified syntax checker tool.)

* GPUFORT does a bad job in analyzing what code parts can be offloaded and which ones not
* GPUFORT does a bad job in reorganizing loops and assignments in order to maximize
  the available parallelism

While both would be possible as the translator works with a tree structure, 
we simply have not started to implement much in this direction yet.

* GPUFORT does not implement the full OpenACC standard (yet)

GPUFORT was developed to translate a number of HPC apps
to code formats that are well supported by AMD's ROCm ecosystem.
The development of GPUFORT is steered by the requirements
of these applications.

### Fortran-C Interoperablity Limitations

To interface generated HIP C++ kernels with the original Fortran code, GPUFORT relies on the `iso_c_binding` interoperability mechanisms that were added to the Fortran language with 
the Fortran 2003 standard. Please be aware that the interoperability of C structs and Fortran derived types is quite limited
till this date:

* "Derived types with the C binding attribute shall not have the sequence attribute, type parameters, the extends attribute, nor type-bound procedures."
* "Every component must be of interoperable type and kind and may not have the **pointer** or **allocatable** attribute. The names of the components are irrelevant for interoperability."

(Source: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Derived-Types-and-struct.html)

We are currently investigating what workarounds could be automatically applied.
Until then, you have to modify your code manually to circumvent the above limitations.

## Currently supported features:

* ACC:
   * ACC2OMP & ACC2HIP
   * Translation of data directives: `!$acc enter data`, `!$acc exit data`, `!$acc data`
   * Synchronization directives: `!$acc wait, !$acc update self/host/device`
   * Kernel and loop constructs `!$acc kernels` plus `!$acc loop` in subsequent line, `!$acc kernels loop`, `!$acc parallel` plus `!$acc loop` 
     in subsequent line, `!$acc parallel loop`, `!$acc loop`
   * Support for `!$acc routine seq` functions with scalar arguments
* CUF:
   * CUF2HIP
     * Majority of CUDA libary functionality via HIPFORT
     * Kernel and loop constructs: `!$cuf kernel do`
     * Overloaded intrinsics: `allocate`, `allocated`, `deallocate`, `deallocated`, `=`
     * Support for CUDA Fortran `attributes(global)` (array and scalar arguments), 
       and `attributes(host,device)`, `attributes(device)` procedures (only scalar arguments supported for the latter)

(List is not complete ...)

## Planned features (or: "more limitations")

* Current work focuses on:
  * ACC:
    * Initial support for `!$acc declare` (detected but not considered in codegen yet)
    * Improve support for`!$acc parallel (loop)`
    * Add support for `!$acc parallel` without `!$acc loop` in next line)
      * Results in `gang` parallelism
    * Add support for `!$acc kernels` without `!$acc loop` in next line)
      * Auto detection of offloadable code parts 
    * Rewrite of GPUFORT Fortran runtime in (HIP) C++
  * ACC/CUF:
    * Support of derived types with allocatable, pointer members
* Planned:
  * Add option for prescribing syntax checker (e.g. use other compiler for syntax checks.)
